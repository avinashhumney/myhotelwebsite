                <p>Had a pleasant experience when I stayed here for a week. Room was spacious, neat and clean. Service
                    was good. Staff were professional and welcoming in nature. Food was tasty, even though rates on menu
                    seemed to be on higher side. Chinnaswamy cricket stadium was visible from my room

                    Nice place in the heart of the city. After the lockdown it really takes lot's of effort to bring it
                    to the normal, I feel sorry for the satuiaton but the room service food and the front desk are
                    really giving their 100% to bringing it to normal. I wish them good. Certainly a good place to stay.
